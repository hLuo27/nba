##Dataframe Manipulation

```{r}
dat <- read_csv('nba2017-players.csv')

#Display those rows associated to players having height less than 70 inches tall.
show(dat[dat$height<70,])

#Display the names and salaries of centres with over 10 years of playing experience
show(dat[dat$position=='C' & dat$experience > 10,c('player','salary')])

#Create a data frame UCLA with the data of players from college UCLA ("University of California, Los Angeles").
ucla <- data.frame(dat[dat$college == "University of California, Los Angeles",])

#Create a data frame rookies with those players with 0 years of experience.
rookies <- data.frame(dat[dat$experience == 0,])

#Create a data frame rookie_centers with the data of Center rookie players.
rookie_centres <- data.frame(rookies[rookies$position == 'C',])

#Create a data frame top_players for players with more than 50 games and more than 300 minutes played.
top_players <- dat[(dat$games > 50) & (dat$minutes > 300),]

#What's the largest height value?
max(dat$height)

#What's the minimum height value?
min(dat$height)

#What's the overall average height?
mean(dat$height)

#Who is the tallest player?
dat[dat$height == max(dat$height),'player']
  
#Who is the shortest player?
dat[dat$height == min(dat$height),'player']

#Which are the unique teams?
unique(dat$team)

#How many different teams?
length(unique(dat$team))

#Who is the oldest player?
dat[dat$age == max(dat$age),'player']

#What is the median salary of all players?
median(dat$salary)

#What is the median salary of the players with 10 years of experience or more?
median(dat[dat$experience >= 10, 'salary'])
  
#What is the median salary of Shooting Guards (SG) and Point Guards (PG)?
median(dat[(dat$position == 'PG') | (dat$position == 'SG'),'salary'])

#What is the median salary of Power Forwards (PF), 29 years or older, and 74 inches tall or less?
median(dat[(dat$position == 'PF') & (dat$age >= 29) & (dat$height <= 74),'salary'])

#How many players are from "University of California, Berkeley"?
nrow(dat[dat$college == "University of California, Berkeley",])

#Are there any players with weight greater than 260 pounds? If so how many and who are they?
nrow(dat[dat$weight > 260,])
dat[dat$weight > 260,'player']

#How many players did not attend a college in the US?
nrow(dat[dat$college == "",])

#Who is the player with the maximum rate of points per minute?
dat[dat$points/dat$minutes == max(dat$points/dat$minutes),'player']

#Who is the player with the maximum rate of 3 pointers per minute?
dat[dat$points3/dat$minutes == max(dat$points3/dat$minutes),'player']

#Create a data frame tor with the name, height, weight of Toronto Raptors (TOR)
tor <- data.frame(dat[dat$team == 'TOR',c('player','height','weight')])

#Display the data in tor sorted by height in increasing order
show(tor[order(tor$height),])

#Display the data in tor by weight in decreasing order
show(tor[rev(order(tor$height)),])

#Display the player name, team, and salary, of the top 5 highest-paid players
show(dat[rev(order(dat$salary))[1:5],c("player","team","salary")])

#Display the player name, team, and points3, of the top 10 three-point players
show(dat[rev(order(dat$points3))[1:10],c("player","team","points3")])
```

##Grouping the Data

```{r}
#Create a data frame with the average height, average weight, and average age, grouped by position
aggregate(dat[,c("height","weight","age")],by = list(dat$age),FUN = mean)

#Create a data frame with the average height, average weight, and average age, grouped by team
aggregate(dat[,c("height","weight","age")],by = list(dat$team),FUN = mean)

#Create a data frame with the average height, average weight, and average age, grouped by team and position.
aggregate(dat[,c("height","weight","age")],by = list(dat$team, dat$position),FUN = mean)

#Difficult: Create a data frame with the minimum salary, median salary, mean salary, and maximum salary, grouped by team and position.
nba_summary <- data.frame(aggregate(dat[,c("salary")],by = list(dat$team, dat$position),FUN = min), 
           aggregate(dat[,c("salary")],by = list(dat$team, dat$position),FUN = median),
           aggregate(dat[,c("salary")],by = list(dat$team, dat$position),FUN = mean),
           aggregate(dat[,c("salary")],by = list(dat$team, dat$position),FUN = max))[,c(1,2,3,6,9,12)]
colnames(nba_summary) <- c("Team","Position","Min Salary", "Median Salary", "Mean Salary", "Max Salary")
nba_summary
